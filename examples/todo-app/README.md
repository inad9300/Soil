Minimalist to-do application, allowing the addition, removal, completion and
filtering of items. It shows in practice how components can be glued together,
as well as one way pure dependency injection can be implemented. [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
is used as module loader.

To start the application, run `npm start`.
