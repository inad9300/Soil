Note-taking application created using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as
bundler.

This application was developed as a challenge to try to create a reasonable
alternative to the application presented in [jQuery vs the Frameworks, or the Lost Art of Application Architecture](https://medium.com/dubanerjee/jquery-vs-the-frameworks-or-the-lost-art-of-application-architecture-49251cc13290),
and originally in [Comparing Frontend Approaches](https://medium.com/actualize-network/comparing-frontend-frameworks-part-1-introduction-6cf3d49e42cf).

To start the application, run `npm start`.
