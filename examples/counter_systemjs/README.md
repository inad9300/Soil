**Warning** Not working since SystemJS 2.0 due to TypeScript's incompatibility.
This issue is under discussion at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/28790.

Very simple counter application, useful for warming up with the coding style
favoured by Soil.

It uses [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) as module loader, after
using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to transpile and bundle the
files together using the SystemJS format.

To start the application, run `npm start`.
